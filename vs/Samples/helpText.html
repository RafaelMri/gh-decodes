<p>This component allows to use both RhinoCommon and RhinoScript from within
Grasshopper. Here some Q&amp;As.</p>

<p><b>How can I use the rhinoscriptsyntax?</b></p>
<p>By importing RhinoScript, for example by writing:</p>
<pre style="font-size: smaller">import rhinoscriptsyntax as rs</pre>
<p>...and then calling some rhinoscript functions...</p>
<pre style="font-size: smaller">line = rs.AddLine((1, 2, 3), (10, 11, 12))
a = line</pre>

<p><b>How can I use RhinoCommon?</b></p>
<p>By importing from the Rhino module, for example by writing:</p>
<pre style="font-size: smaller">from Rhino.Geometry import Point3d, Line</pre>
<p>...and then assigning some new geometry to the results</p>
<pre style="font-size: smaller">a = Line(Point3d(1, 2, 3), Point3d(10, 11, 12))</pre>

<p><b>What is "ghdoc" and how does it relate to the rhinoscriptsyntax?</b></p>
<p>The ghdoc variable is provided by the component for better RhinoScript
library support.<br>
This library is imperative, and it is build from a set of
functions that act on geometrical types through one level of indirection:
most of the time, the user does not work with the geometry itself
but with an identifier (Guid) of geometry that is present in a document.<br>
This is exactly what ghdoc is: it is a reference to the document that the RhinoScript
library implicitly targets with all Add__() calls (for example, AddLine()).<br>
The scriptcontext module has a doc variable with the currenly active document,
that can be assigned by you to ghdoc, or RhinoDoc.ActiveDoc, the Rhino document.
</p>

<p><b>Is RhinoScript use within GhPython less ideal than RhinoCommon?</b></p>
<p>While targeting the ghdoc variable, the special Grasshopper document
is used, therefore we can use Grasshopper while leaving the Rhino document unchanged.
This saves uncountable Undo's, and makes it easy to structure ideas
through the Grasshopper definition.<br>
This means that both RhinoCommon or RhinoScript are good in practice.</p>

<p><b>Is the rhinoscriptsyntax target irrelevant if using solely RhinoCommon
classes?</b></p>
<p>Yes. If you create class instances (objects), you will need to create
also your own collection objects to store them (mostly lists, trees). You
can imagine the ghdoc as being an alternative to them, just that you do
not access data by index (number), but by Guid. So you can use the
RhinoScript or the RhinoCommon libraries independently or mix them.
The RhinoScript implementation in Rhino is open-source and is all written
in RhinoCommon. Also the ghdoc implementation is open-source, and is
<a href="https://github.com/mcneel/ghpython/blob/master/DocReplacement/CustomTable.cs" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Are there RhinoScript and/or RhinoCommon objects which are not
recognized as valid Grasshopper geometry?</b></p>
<p>Yes, sure, Grasshopper handles only a portion of all available types.<br>
Basically, unhandled types are all the types that do not exists in the
'Params' tab.<br>
For example, there is no textdot and no leader. When/if Grasshopper one day
will support these types, these calls will be implemented.</p>

<p><b>How do I use DataTree's?</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.grasshopper3d.com/forum/topics/datatreelistitem-access-from" target="_blank">Here</a>
is a small sample.<br>
However, 80% of the times it is not necessary to program for
DataTrees, as the logic itself can be applied per-list and Grasshopper handles
list-iteration.</p>

<p><b>Any more tips?</b></p>
<p>It's probably quite easy to get started, but then you might need to know some more tips to be
proficient. Many tricks have to do with Python (for example, do you know the type() and dir() functions)?
Other might have more to do with the component setup. (There's even a secret ghenv variable).</p>
